# Project Ares Protocol

Protocol for Minecraft clients to interface with Project Ares servers.

## Building

Protocol uses Google's [protobuf](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) library
for compiling the protocol description files. You will need to download the
`protoc` compiler and copy it to this root folder in order to build.
